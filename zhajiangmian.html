    <h2> Description </h3>
        <p> Traditional Beijing-style noodles with a fried soybean sauce and fresh vegetables. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 300g Ganhuangjiang or Akamiso </li>
        <li> 50g Tianmianjiang or Hoisin Sauce </li>
        <li> 150g Boiled Water </li>
        <li> 1/3cup Oil</li>
        <li> 100g Pork Belly</li>
        <li> 1 Leek, cut into 8cm sections </li>
        <li> 8cm. Ginger</li>
        <li> 1/4cup Sugar</li>
        <li> 1tsp. salt</li>
        <li> 0.5tsp. MSG</li>
        <li> 8cm Carrot, julienned </li>
        <li> 8cm Cucumber, julienned </li>
        <li> 8cm Celery, blanched for 10 seconds then minced </li>
        <li> 200g (or choice amount) Shouganmian </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol> 
        <li> Using a non-stick Teflon pan, Add the ganhuangjiang (or red miso) and tianmianjiang to a bowl and slowly pour in the hot, boiled water while stirring constantly. </li>
        <li> Once everything's combined well, set it aside. </li>
        <li> Dice the pork belly, chop the leek into sections, and smash the ginger. </li>
        <li> Over medium heat, add in the oil and the pork belly. Fry for ~2 minutes until a couple of the pieces are just starting to turn ever so slightly golden and reserve the pork. </li>
        <li> Same medium heat, add the leek and ginger. Fry for ~2 minutes to flavor the oil. </li>
        <li> With the heat on low now, toss the bean paste mixture into the oil. Fry, stirring constantly, for 15 minutes. At first the oil and the paste'll be separate, but as it cooks it'll begin to combine. Once all of the oil's more or less combined into the paste, move onto the next step.</li>
        <li> Add back the pork pieces, and continue stirring for ~20 minutes. As it cooks, more oil will render out and get reabsorbed into the sauce. After 20 minutes you should be looking at a sauce where most of the oil is incorporated, but there's a thin layer of excess lard. </li>
        <li> Season, then cook for another minute to dissolve in the salt, sugar, and MSG. </li>
        <li> Prepare the noodles according to directions. </li>
        <li> Add noodles, mix together with some of the sauce. Top with vegetables and serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
