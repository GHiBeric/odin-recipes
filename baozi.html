    <h2> Description </h3>
        <p> Soft, steamed buns with tender ground pork inside. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 250g All-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 185g Water </li>
        <li> 2g Active, Dry Yeast </li>
        <li> 5g Sugar </li>
        <li> 180g 90/10 Boston Butt pork </li>
        <li> 1.25cm Ginger </li>
        <li> 7.5cm Leek, cut into 3 sections </li>
        <li> 2 Star Anise </li>
        <li> 1/2 Black Cardamom Pod </li>
        <li> 1tsp. Fennel Seed </li>
        <li> 1tsp. Sichuan Peppercorn </li>
        <li> 1/4tsp. Salt </li>
        <li> 1/4tsp. Sugar </li>
        <li> 1/2tsp. Corn Starch </li>
        <li> 1/8tsp. White Pepper Powder </li>
        <li> 1/2tbsp. Light Soy Sauce </li>
        <li>1/2tsp. Liaojiu </li>
        <li> 1tsp. Toasted Sesame Oil </li> 
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol> 
        <li> Add the yeast and sugar to the water and mix well. Again, note that you might need to add a bit more water depending on your flour, so it could be a nice idea to start with 100 grams with this step and move on from there.</li>
        <li> Slowly add the water into your flour. Stir with a chopstick and aim for the dry parts. </li>
        <li> Evaluate dough consistency. If it's still dry and crumbly, add a little more water.</li>
        <li> Knead for eight minutes. This kind of dough needs a strong gluten network in order for it to maintain its shape. If you find that your Baozi are 'flattening', one very likely culprit is under-kneading it. </li>
        <li> Shape the dough into a ball. After kneading, there'll be one side of the dough that's a bit more 'craggly' - pinch that closed, then toss that side down on a silpat and shape the dough just like you were making bread. </li>
        <li> Let the dough rise for 90 minutes. Or until it doubles in size. </li>
        <li> Add the spices to the hot, boiled water and let it infuse at least 30 minutes, until cooled. Remember to crush your ginger and leek. </li>
        <li> Dice the pork, then mince by hand for ~3 minutes until relatively pasty. </li>
        <li> Add the seasoning to the minced pork except the toasted sesame oil, and start to stir in one direction only. </li>
        <li> Strain the now cooled spice water, and add it in a tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly. After adding it all, continue to stir for ~5 minutes. Stirring helps develop the myosin in the pork, allowing it to form a stickier, more uniform whole. Similar concept as in sausage making. </li>
        <li> Mix in the sesame oil. </li>
        <li> Chill until you're ready to wrap. This'll wrap way easier if it's cooled down. Pop it in the freezer for an hour if you can. </li>
        <li> Punch down the dough, transfer to a well-floured work surface. It will still be a bit sticky at this point. Dust the top with some flour. </li>
        <li> Roll the dough out into a large even sheet, covering your work surface. For reference, we were looking at roughly 30 cm by 40 cm. </li>
        <li> Tightly roll up the sheet of dough into a log, and cut into eight pieces. For this recipe, each piece will be about 47.5 grams each. You obviously don't need to nail that exactly though. </li>
        <li> Shape each piece into a round ball. Press the piece down to get a flat square. Fold each corner into the center, then squeeze the dough between your thumb and index finger to pinch it closed, pinching up any excess - you should be looking at something that is mostly round. Then place the 'excess' between your thumb and index finger, twisting it up and on top of the ball. Roll the ball a bit, shape it by twisting like bread, and you should have a real nice, even ball. </li>
        <li> Roll out each ball into a wrapper. Press down on a ball, then with a rolling pin, roll into the dough without force then press, and roll back out with force, working around the ball of dough. This motion helps get the center of the Baozi thicker than the edges, which's important because (1) it allows the center to hold more filling without breaking and (2) it's vastly easier to pleat. </li>
        <li> Wrap the Baozi. Add 30g of the pork filling to the Baozi wrapper, then start to pleat. Pinch down on the side, then hold that first pleat with your thumb. As you pleat, periodically press the filling down and in. Once you reach the 'end', close it up and twist it up towards the very top of the Baozi, pinching it to the center. Shape a bit with your hands to make sure everything's all pretty. </li>
        <li> As your wrap, place the Baozi in a steamer lined with Bao-sized squares of parchment paper. Roughly 6.5cm by 6.5cm squares. </li>
        <li> Place the whole steamer over some 38 centigrade water, then spritz the very top of the Baozi with a bit of water, and proof for 30 minutes. The Baozi will get significantly larger over the course of 30 minutes. If you want smaller, denser Baozi, aim instead for ~15-20. </li>
        <li> Steam, first placing the whole thing over high heat to bring the water up to a boil. Then lower the flame to medium, and steam those for 15 minutes. That's right, the steamer with the Baozi is on the pot of water as it's getting up to a boil. </li>
    </ol>
